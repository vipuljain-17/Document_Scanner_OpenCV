# General Info
A document scanner can be build using basic image processing techniques, inorder to achieve the result

*Usually the process takes only three main process:-*
1. Detect the edge
2. Use the edges in the image to find the contour (outline) representing the piece of paper being scanned.
3. Apply a perspective transform to obtain the top-down view of the document.

# Installing and running the project on local machine
Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/vipuljain-17/Document_Scanner_OpenCV.git
```
Go to the project directory
```
cd Document_Scanner_OpenCV
```
Run the shell script to install required packages and start the program.
```
./run.sh
```

- If you face any permission errors while running the shell script. Write the given code.
  ```
  chmod +x run.sh
  ```
  This provides you with the execution rights in order to run the script.


Or, Just click on the run.sh file!
