# General Info
A document scanner can be build using basic image processing techniques, inorder to achieve the result

*Usually the process takes only three main process:-*
1. Detect the edge
2. Use the edges in the image to find the contour (outline) representing the piece of paper being scanned.
3. Apply a perspective transform to obtain the top-down view of the document.

# Libraries Used
- OpenCV
- Python3
- Scikit-image
- Tkinter
- PIL
